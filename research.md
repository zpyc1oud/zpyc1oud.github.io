            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My research focuses on <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, a field that combines 
                computer science, artificial intelligence, and digital image processing to enable 
                machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world.

                        Exploring advanced techniques in image understanding, including image 
                        classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene 
                        understanding. I'm particularly interested in how deep learning models 
                        can be designed to better understand visual content.

                        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and 
                        other state-of-the-art architectures. I'm also interested in model 
                        optimization and efficiency.

            <h2>Current Work</h2>
            <p>
                As an undergraduate student, I'm currently in the early stages of my research 
                journey. I'm actively learning the fundamentals of computer vision and machine 
                learning, working on various projects to build my understanding and skills.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the potential applications of computer vision in various 
                domains such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented 
                reality. As I continue my studies, I hope to contribute meaningful research 
                to this rapidly evolving field.
